This project is basic page builder with a number of elements from [Tizzy HTML template](https://themeforest.net/item/trizzy-multipurpose-ecommerce-html-template/7950329) wich my company is using for the main ecommerce site

## WHY?

The custom Laravel CMS doesnt have good enoguht rich text editor for Graphic Designer to write blog posts and pages in it, so I have to write HTML for everything. I want to get rid of that job with this small App.
